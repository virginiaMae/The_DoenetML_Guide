    <title>Introduction to DoenetML</title>
  
    
<p><alert>How to Use this Tutorial.</alert>
  If you're learning DoenetML for the first time, you should read each section in order.  
  If you skip around, you're likely to miss something important.  Certain features (such as "attributes") 
  are introduced in the midst of discussing other topics. Keep the following in mind:</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li><p>Throughout the tutorial, you'll find code editors which show you both 
        DoenetML code and the resulting display on the screen.  These code editors are "live," 
        meaning you can change the DoenetML code, click "update," and see how the display changes.  
        <em>You should do this!</em>. Experimenting with these snippets of DoenetML code is a great 
        way to learn the language.</p></li>
  
      <li><p>If you need to review a topic, come back to this annotated table of contents. 
        Use your browser's search function to see where a certain tag (a basic building block of DonetML) 
        or other concept is covered.</p></li>
  </ul>
  
    <p>Finally: this entire tutorial is written using DoenetML!  You can click the "See Inside" button 
      on any page to study the code which produced everything you see on screen.</p>
