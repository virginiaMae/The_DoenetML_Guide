  <title>Sectional Components</title>

  <p>Content on a page is organized within a heirarchy that is defined by the use of what we will call
    <term>sectional components</term>. Some sectional components have a default auto-naming or auto-numbering
    schema built-in (that can, however, usually be overwritten by the author with the use of custom <term>attributes</term>).
    Some of the more common sectional components are <tag>section</tag>, <tag>problem</tag>, <tag>figure</tag>, and <tag>exercise</tag>.
    The most frequently used sectional component is the paragraph tag, which is abbreviated to just <tag>p</tag>. 
  </p>
  <p>Sectional components in DoenetML are designed to match the rendering behavior of those used in 
    <ref uri="source/ch-1-Quick_Start.ptx">PreTeXt</ref>.</p>
