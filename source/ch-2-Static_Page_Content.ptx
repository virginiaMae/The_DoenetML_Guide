  <title>Static Page Content</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>This chapter covers the basics of creating textbook-like content in DoenetML. For these applications,
      the language is very similar to <ref uri="source/ch-1-Quick_Start.ptx">PreTeXt</ref>.  Here you will learn how
      structural divisions of content are organized with what are referred to as <term>sectional components</term>, as well
      as how to embed videos, images, simple graphs, and links to external content.
