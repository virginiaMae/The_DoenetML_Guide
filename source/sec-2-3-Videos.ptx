  <title>Videos</title>

  <p>To embed videos with DoenetML, you can use the <tag>video</tag> component. If it is also desired to include
    captions, or descriptions, it may be beneficial to nest the <tag>video</tag> component within a <tag>figure</tag>. 
    A direct link to the video may be provided with the <attr>source</attr> attribute, or if the video is hosted on YouTube,
    one can use the <attr>youtube</attr> attribute. The rendered appearance of the video can be adjusted with the <attr>width</attr>, 
    or <attr>size</attr> attributes, among others.   
  </p>
  <p>It is also possible to access data from the <tag>video</tag> component with respect to the user's interactions
    with the content. This will be covered in greater detail in the chapter on <xref ref="./ch-7-Dynamic_Page_Content" text="title"/>
